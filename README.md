# Weather App
This is one of two of my final projects for SheCodes React Workshop, React Development Certification.
The app is hosted on Netlify: https://focused-archimedes-20c5a0.netlify.app/

## Description
For live weather data I used an API from openweathermap.org.
The app is not collecting or storing any data from the user. The primary function is to display current weather data and forecast for the user's searched city or current geolocation.

## Functions
+ search weather in a specific city or your current geolocation
+ current weather conditions (feels-like temperature, wind speed, humidity)
+ 5 day weather forecast (with maximum and minimum temperatures)
+ forecast for the next 10 hours
+ change temperature units to celcius or farenheit
